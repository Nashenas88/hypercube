# Session Summary: Building a 4D Rubik's Cube

This session focused on establishing the foundational requirements and initial technical setup for a 4D Rubik's Cube application, successfully implementing complete 4D rendering with interactive controls.

## Key Decisions & Requirements:

*   **Application Goal:** Create a 4D Rubik's Cube application.
*   **Cube Geometry & Visualization:**
    *   The 4D hypercube is represented as 8 separate 3x3x3 arrangements of single-colored 3D "sticker-cubes".
    *   Each "side" (3x3x3 block) has a distinct color, totaling 216 visible sticker-cubes.
    *   The 8 faces are positioned at tesseract vertices with proper 4D coordinates at ±1.0 boundaries.
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Language:** Rust (confirmed by existing project structure).
    *   **Graphics:** `wgpu` was chosen over `vulkano` and `ash` for its safety, ease of use, and portability, allowing focus on 4D logic.
    *   **4D Math:** `nalgebra` is used for 4D matrix operations and 4D-to-3D projection on the CPU.

## Progress Made:

### Core Infrastructure:
1.  **Requirements Document:** Created `requirements.md` to formalize the project requirements.
2.  **Dependency Setup:** Added `wgpu`, `nalgebra`, `winit`, `env_logger`, `pollster`, and `bytemuck` to `Cargo.toml`.
3.  **Core Data Structures:** Defined `Color`, `Sticker`, `Side`, and `Hypercube` structs in `src/cube.rs` to represent the 4D cube's state.
4.  **Basic `wgpu` Boilerplate:** Set up `src/main.rs` with a complete `wgpu` application.
5.  **Shader System:** Created comprehensive shader system:
    *   `compute.wgsl`: 4D transformations, projections, and face culling
    *   `shader.wgsl`: Vertex and fragment shaders for final rendering
    *   `clear.wgsl`: Dark gray background shader for better visibility

### Rendering Pipeline:
6.  **GPU Compute Pipeline:** Implemented compute shader for efficient 4D transformations and culling.
7.  **4D Face Culling:** Proper culling system showing only front-facing faces (typically 7 out of 8).
8.  **Hardware Triangle Culling:** Combined with 4D culling for optimal performance.
9.  **Camera System:** Implemented 3D camera with orbital controls around the hypercube origin.
10. **Depth Testing:** Added proper depth buffer and depth testing for correct z-ordering.
11. **4D Projection:** Implemented 4D-to-3D perspective projection with configurable viewer distance.

### Interactive Controls:
12. **Mouse Controls:** 
    *   Right mouse drag: 3D camera rotation around hypercube
    *   Right mouse drag + Shift: 4D rotation of the hypercube itself
    *   Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out with distance constraints
13. **UI Controls:** Interactive sliders for sticker scale and face spacing adjustment.
14. **State Management:** Clean separation between `App` state (hypercube, camera, 4D rotation) and `Renderer` (graphics resources).

### 4D Mathematics:
15. **4D Positioning:** Proper tesseract geometry with 8 faces positioned at ±1.0 coordinates.
16. **4D Rotation:** Real-time 4D rotation matrices for XW and YW planes with accumulative rotation.
17. **GPU Compute:** All 4D transformations and projections performed efficiently on GPU.
18. **Dynamic Updates:** Real-time compute shader updates for smooth 4D transformations.

### Lighting System:
19. **Directional Lighting:** Sun-like directional light from upper right with warm color temperature.
20. **Phong Lighting Model:** Ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting components for realistic shading.
21. **Normal Calculation:** Normals computed from actual projected vertices in compute shader.
22. **Multiple Rendering Pipelines:** Separate pipelines for standard lighting, normal visualization, and depth visualization.
23. **Integrated Vertex Structure:** Normals now stored directly in vertex data for consistent access across all shaders.
24. **Ongoing Challenge:** Normal orientation consistency across 4D transformations remains problematic.

## Architecture:

*   **App Struct:** Contains all application state including hypercube data, camera controller, 4D rotation matrix, and input state.
*   **Renderer Struct:** Pure rendering system that accepts external data (camera, projection, hypercube state).
*   **Clean Separation:** App handles logic and input, Renderer handles graphics, with clear interfaces between them.

## Current Features:

*   **Complete 4D Hypercube Visualization:** All 8 faces properly positioned and rendered in 4D space.
*   **Interactive 4D Exploration:** Users can rotate the hypercube in 4D space to see different cross-sections.
*   **Proper 3D Navigation:** Standard 3D camera controls for viewing the projected hypercube from different angles.
*   **4D Face Culling:** Intelligent culling shows only front-facing faces for proper depth perception.
*   **Visual Depth Cues:** Depth testing ensures correct visual ordering of sticker cubes.
*   **Enhanced Visibility:** Dark gray background with adjusted colors for better contrast.
*   **Smooth Controls:** Responsive mouse controls with interactive UI sliders.
*   **Debug Visualization Modes:** Real-time switching between standard lighting, normal map, and depth map views.
*   **Optimized Rendering:** 36-vertex per cube architecture with baked-in normals for improved performance.

## Constants and Configuration:

*   `STICKER_SCALE = 0.8`: Size of individual sticker cubes
*   `STICKER_SPACING = 1.2`: Spacing between stickers within sides
*   `VIEWER_DISTANCE_4D = 3.0`: 4D projection distance
*   `MOUSE_SENSITIVITY = 0.5`: Mouse rotation sensitivity
*   `PROJECTION_FOVY = 45.0`: Camera field of view
*   Zoom constraints: 5.0 to 50.0 units distance

## Control Scheme:

*   **Right Mouse + Drag:** 3D camera orbital rotation
*   **Right Mouse + Shift + Drag:** 4D hypercube rotation (XW and YW planes)
*   **Mouse Wheel:** Zoom in/out
*   **Window Resize:** Automatic aspect ratio adjustment

## Next Steps:

The foundation is now complete with proper 4D geometry, efficient GPU rendering, and comprehensive debug visualization. The immediate priority is resolving the normal consistency issue:

### Priority 1: Normal System Fixes:
*   **Alternative Normal Calculation:** Investigate using 4D cross products or predefined face orientations
*   **Determinant-Based Orientation:** Use matrix determinants to detect orientation flips during 4D-to-3D projection
*   **Face-Specific Normal Correction:** Apply per-face orientation corrections based on 4D transformation analysis
*   **Lighting Quality Verification:** Test lighting improvements after normal fixes

### Priority 2: Game Mechanics:
*   Add 4D rotation animations for cube "twists"
*   Implement scrambling algorithms
*   Add solving algorithms and move notation
*   Enhance visual feedback for move selection
*   Add undo/redo functionality
*   Implement save/load of cube states
*   Expand UI controls for game mechanics

### Debug Visualization System (IMPLEMENTED):
*   **Multiple Rendering Modes:** Added UI dropdown to switch between Standard, Normal Map, and Depth Map visualization
*   **Normal Map Debugging:** Successfully implemented normal vector visualization as RGB colors
*   **Depth Map Rendering:** Added depth buffer visualization for debugging depth issues
*   **36-Vertex Architecture:** Restructured from 8 shared vertices per cube to 36 dedicated vertices (6 faces × 6 vertices)
*   **Baked-in Normals:** Each vertex now stores position, color, and normal directly - eliminated complex indexing
*   **Sequential Rendering:** Removed index buffer usage, switched to direct vertex array rendering

### Current Issues (IDENTIFIED):
*   **Normal Inconsistency:** Despite implementing normal map visualization and improving calculation logic, some 4D faces still show inverted normals
*   **4D Transformation Effects:** Normal orientation appears to be affected by 4D rotations in unpredictable ways
*   **Root Cause:** Normal calculation method using 4D face direction may not account for all geometric edge cases during 4D-to-3D projection

### Technical Achievements:
*   **Diagnostic Success:** Normal map mode now clearly reveals the extent of the normal orientation problem
*   **Architecture Improvement:** Cleaner vertex structure with direct normal storage
*   **Debug Capability:** Real-time normal visualization enables systematic debugging of 4D geometry issues
