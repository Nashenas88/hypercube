# Session Summary: Building a 4D Rubik's Cube

This session focused on establishing the foundational requirements and initial technical setup for a 4D Rubik's Cube application, and then moved into implementing basic rendering with a camera and preparing for instanced drawing.

## Key Decisions & Requirements:

*   **Application Goal:** Create a 4D Rubik's Cube application.
*   **Cube Geometry & Visualization:**
    *   The 4D hypercube will be visually represented as 8 separate 3x3x3 arrangements of single-colored 3D "sticker-cubes".
    *   Each "side" (3x3x3 block) will initially have a distinct color, totaling 216 visible sticker-cubes.
    *   The center sticker-cube of each of the 8 "sides" will have a fixed color and position, acting as a frame of reference.
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Language:** Rust (confirmed by existing project structure).
    *   **Graphics:** `wgpu` was chosen over `vulkano` and `ash` for its safety, ease of use, and portability, allowing focus on 4D logic.
    *   **4D Math:** `nalgebra` will be used for 5x5 matrix operations and other 4D calculations on the CPU.

## Progress Made:

1.  **Requirements Document:** Created `requirements.md` to formalize the project requirements.
2.  **Dependency Setup:** Added `wgpu`, `nalgebra`, `winit`, `env_logger`, `pollster`, and `bytemuck` to `Cargo.toml`.
3.  **Core Data Structures:** Defined `Color`, `Sticker`, `Side`, and `Hypercube` structs in `src/cube.rs` to represent the 4D cube's state.
4.  **Basic `wgpu` Boilerplate:** Set up `src/main.rs` with a minimal `wgpu` application that opens a window.
5.  **Shader Creation:** Created `src/shader.wgsl` with a basic vertex and fragment shader.
6.  **Single Cube Rendering (Fixed):** Integrated the cube geometry, shader, and `wgpu` pipeline to successfully render a single red 3D cube in the application window. This involved fixing a `front_face` culling issue.
7.  **Camera Implementation:**
    *   Added `Camera` and `Projection` structs using `nalgebra` for view and projection matrices.
    *   Updated `src/main.rs` to include these structs and calculate the view-projection matrix.
    *   Modified `src/shader.wgsl` to accept and use the `view_proj` matrix from a uniform buffer.
8.  **Instancing Preparation:**
    *   Defined `Instance` and `InstanceRaw` structs in `src/main.rs` for per-instance data (model matrix and color).
    *   Added `From<Color> for nalgebra::Vector4<f32>` implementation in `src/cube.rs` for color conversion.
    *   Updated `Renderer` struct to include `instance_buffer` and `num_instances` fields.

## Challenges Encountered:

*   Repeated compilation errors due to `wgpu`/`winit` API changes and incorrect syntax (e.g., accidental triple quotes in Rust and WGSL files). These were resolved through iterative fixes and careful use of `write_file` to ensure correct content.
*   Misunderstanding of `wgpu`'s `front_face` and `cull_mode` settings, leading to an invisible cube. This was resolved by changing `front_face` to `Cw`.
*   Errors in applying `replace` commands due to my internal state not matching the actual file content, leading to the decision to use `write_file` for comprehensive updates.
*   Overwriting shader initialization code during instancing implementation, which will be addressed in the next steps.

## Next Steps:

*   Correctly implement the generation of instance data from the `Hypercube` state.
*   Create the instance buffer in `Renderer::new`.
*   Update the render pipeline's vertex buffer layout to properly handle per-instance data.
*   Modify the `shader.wgsl` to use the per-instance model matrix and color.
*   Update the `render` function to draw all instances using `draw_indexed(..., 0..self.num_instances)`.
