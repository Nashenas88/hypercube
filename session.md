# Session Summary: Building a 4D Rubik's Cube

This session focused on establishing the foundational requirements and initial technical setup for a 4D Rubik's Cube application, successfully implementing complete 4D rendering with interactive controls.

## Key Decisions & Requirements:

*   **Application Goal:** Create a 4D Rubik's Cube application.
*   **Cube Geometry & Visualization:**
    *   The 4D hypercube is represented as 8 separate 3x3x3 arrangements of single-colored 3D "sticker-cubes".
    *   Each "side" (3x3x3 block) has a distinct color, totaling 216 visible sticker-cubes.
    *   The 8 sides are positioned at proper 4D coordinates: 7 sides arranged around a center in one W-plane, and 1 side in another W-plane.
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Language:** Rust (confirmed by existing project structure).
    *   **Graphics:** `wgpu` was chosen over `vulkano` and `ash` for its safety, ease of use, and portability, allowing focus on 4D logic.
    *   **4D Math:** `nalgebra` is used for 4D matrix operations and 4D-to-3D projection on the CPU.

## Progress Made:

### Core Infrastructure:
1.  **Requirements Document:** Created `requirements.md` to formalize the project requirements.
2.  **Dependency Setup:** Added `wgpu`, `nalgebra`, `winit`, `env_logger`, `pollster`, and `bytemuck` to `Cargo.toml`.
3.  **Core Data Structures:** Defined `Color`, `Sticker`, `Side`, and `Hypercube` structs in `src/cube.rs` to represent the 4D cube's state.
4.  **Basic `wgpu` Boilerplate:** Set up `src/main.rs` with a complete `wgpu` application.
5.  **Shader Creation:** Created `src/shader.wgsl` with vertex and fragment shaders supporting per-instance data.

### Rendering Pipeline:
6.  **Instanced Rendering:** Successfully implemented instanced rendering for all 216 sticker cubes.
7.  **Camera System:** Implemented 3D camera with orbital controls around the hypercube origin.
8.  **Depth Testing:** Added proper depth buffer and depth testing for correct z-ordering.
9.  **4D Projection:** Implemented 4D-to-3D perspective projection with configurable viewer distance.

### Interactive Controls:
10. **Mouse Controls:** 
    *   Right mouse drag: 3D camera rotation around hypercube
    *   Right mouse drag + Shift: 4D rotation of the hypercube itself
    *   Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out with distance constraints
11. **State Management:** Clean separation between `App` state (hypercube, camera, 4D rotation) and `Renderer` (graphics resources).

### 4D Mathematics:
12. **4D Positioning:** Proper 4D coordinate system with 8 sides positioned at distinct 4D locations.
13. **4D Rotation:** Real-time 4D rotation matrices for XW and YW planes with accumulative rotation.
14. **Dynamic Updates:** Real-time instance buffer updates for smooth 4D transformations.

## Architecture:

*   **App Struct:** Contains all application state including hypercube data, camera controller, 4D rotation matrix, and input state.
*   **Renderer Struct:** Pure rendering system that accepts external data (camera, projection, hypercube state).
*   **Clean Separation:** App handles logic and input, Renderer handles graphics, with clear interfaces between them.

## Current Features:

*   **Complete 4D Hypercube Visualization:** All 8 sides properly positioned and rendered in 4D space.
*   **Interactive 4D Exploration:** Users can rotate the hypercube in 4D space to see different cross-sections.
*   **Proper 3D Navigation:** Standard 3D camera controls for viewing the projected hypercube from different angles.
*   **Visual Depth Cues:** Depth testing ensures correct visual ordering of sticker cubes.
*   **Smooth Controls:** Responsive mouse and keyboard controls with configurable sensitivity.

## Constants and Configuration:

*   `STICKER_SCALE = 0.8`: Size of individual sticker cubes
*   `STICKER_SPACING = 1.2`: Spacing between stickers within sides
*   `VIEWER_DISTANCE_4D = 3.0`: 4D projection distance
*   `MOUSE_SENSITIVITY = 0.5`: Mouse rotation sensitivity
*   `PROJECTION_FOVY = 45.0`: Camera field of view
*   Zoom constraints: 5.0 to 50.0 units distance

## Control Scheme:

*   **Right Mouse + Drag:** 3D camera orbital rotation
*   **Right Mouse + Shift + Drag:** 4D hypercube rotation (XW and YW planes)
*   **Mouse Wheel:** Zoom in/out
*   **Window Resize:** Automatic aspect ratio adjustment

## Next Steps:

The foundation is now complete for implementing Rubik's cube mechanics:
*   Add 4D rotation animations for cube "twists"
*   Implement scrambling algorithms
*   Add solving algorithms and move notation
*   Enhance visual feedback for move selection
*   Add undo/redo functionality
*   Implement save/load of cube states
